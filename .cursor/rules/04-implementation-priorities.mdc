# Implementation Priorities

## Core Systems (Implement First)
1. **Game Loop & Basic Architecture** - Set up the MonoGame project structure
2. **Character Movement & Controls** - Basic top-down movement with platform-specific input handling
3. **Combat Fundamentals** - Attack, dodge, collision detection
4. **Procedural Generation** - Room and dungeon layout generation
5. **Aetherium Weaving** - The signature feature allowing temporary enhancement of gear/abilities

## Secondary Systems
- **Meta Progression** - Hub area and persistent upgrades
- **Enemy AI** - Behavior patterns and attack sequences
- **UI/UX Development** - Menu systems and HUD elements
- **Audio Implementation** - Sound effects and music

## Cross-Platform Considerations
- Design UI elements to work well on both large (PC) and small (mobile) screens
- Implement flexible control schemes that adapt to platform capabilities
- Optimize performance for mobile targets without compromising core gameplay

# IMPORTANT:
# Always read memory-bank/@architecture.md before writing any code. Include entire database schema.
# Always read memory-bank/@game-design-document.md before writing any code.
# After adding a major feature or completing a milestone, update memory-bank/@architecture.md.
# Always emphasize modularity (multiple files) and discourage a monolith (one giant file).

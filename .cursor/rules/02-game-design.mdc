# Game Design Guidelines

## Core Gameplay Loop
1. **Prepare** in the Hub
2. **Enter Dungeon** and explore randomly generated layouts
3. **Combat** enemies in real-time using weapons, spells, and skills
4. **Loot & Enhance** gear through the Aetherium Weaving system
5. **Boss Battle** to progress deeper
6. **Return to Hub** after death or victory
7. Spend meta-currency for **Meta Progression**

## Key Systems
- **Aetherium Weaving**: The unique selling point allowing temporary augmentation of equipment and abilities during a run
- **Randomly Generated Dungeons**: Different room types and increasing difficulty
- **Real-Time Combat**: Top-down perspective with core actions (Move, Attack, Dodge, Use Spell/Skill)
- **In-Run Progression**: Equipment, spells, and skills found during runs
- **Meta Progression**: Persistent upgrades using Echo Shards in the Hub

## Art Direction
Clean 2D visuals with clear feedback for gameplay elements. UI design must be scalable for both PC and mobile screens.

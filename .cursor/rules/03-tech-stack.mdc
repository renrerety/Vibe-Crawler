# Technology Stack Guidelines

## Core Technologies
- **Framework**: MonoGame - Used for cross-platform 2D game development
- **Language**: C# - The primary programming language for all development
- **IDE**: Cursor - The AI-enabled IDE used for development

## Implementation Details
- **Physics & Collision**: Custom implementation using Axis-Aligned Bounding Boxes (AABB)
- **UI System**: Custom implementation using MonoGame's SpriteBatch
- **Input Handling**: Must support both PC (Keyboard/Mouse/Controller) and Mobile (Touch)

## Code Structure Principles
- Maintain clear separation between game systems (combat, procedural generation, etc.)
- Optimize for both PC and mobile performance
- Implement platform-specific input handling while maintaining core game logic consistency

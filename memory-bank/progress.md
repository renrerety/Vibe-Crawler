3. **State Management**
   - Created StateManager class to handle game states (MainMenu, Gameplay, Paused)
   - Implemented state transitions with event notifications
   - Added debugging controls (P key to toggle Pause, M key for MainMenu)
   - Established state-specific Update and Draw methods

### Technical Details
- Used C# with MonoGame framework
- Implemented event-based state management for clean separation of concerns
- Designed with modularity in mind to support future development
- Added proper logging to verify system operation

### Next Steps
- Proceed to Phase 2: Player Entity & Basic Movement
  - Create Player class with position and sprite
  - Implement InputManager for abstracted input handling
  - Add basic movement mechanics
  - Implement screen boundaries

### Documentation
- Created initial architecture.md to document the project structure and components
- Updated with diagrams of data flow and component relationships

## Phase 2: Player Entity & Basic Movement (COMPLETED)

**Date:** 2025-05-05

### Summary

### Achievements
1. **Player Entity**
   - Created Player class with position and sprite properties
   - Implemented rendering in the game loop
   - Added LastMovementDirection tracking for future attack direction

2. **Input Management**
   - Created InputManager class for abstracted input handling
   - Defined GameAction enum for platform-agnostic controls
   - Implemented keyboard and gamepad support
   - Created methods for checking pressed and just-pressed actions

3. **Movement System**
   - Implemented movement vector calculation
   - Added frame-rate independent movement
   - Created screen boundary checking to keep player on screen

### Technical Details
- Used Vector2 for position and movement direction

### Next Steps
- Proceed to Phase 3: Basic Combat Fundamentals
  - Implement collision detection system
  - Create attack mechanics for player
  - Add basic enemy entity
  - Implement damage and health system

### Documentation
- Updated architecture.md with input management and player entity details
- Added movement system diagrams

## Phase 3: Basic Combat Fundamentals (COMPLETED)

**Date:** 2025-05-05

### Summary
Successfully implemented the fundamental combat mechanics, including attack actions, collision detection, enemy health/damage, and dodge functionality.

### Achievements
1. **Collision Detection**
   - Created CollisionUtility class with AABB collision function
   - Implemented rectangle-based collision detection
   - Added bounds calculation for entities

2. **Attack System**
   - Added attack hitbox generation in player's facing direction
   - Implemented attack timer for limited duration
   - Created visual debug rendering for attack hitbox
   - Added input mapping for attack action (Space key)

3. **Enemy Implementation**
   - Created Enemy class with position, sprite, bounds, and health properties
   - Implemented damage handling and death state
   - Added active flag for enemy removal when defeated

4. **Dodge Mechanics**
   - Implemented dodge action with temporary invincibility
   - Added speed boost during dodge action
   - Created visual effect for invincibility state
   - Added input mapping for dodge action (Shift key)

### Technical Details
- Used Rectangle-based collision detection for precise hit detection
- Implemented timer-based state management for attacks and dodges
- Applied color transforms for visual feedback on game states
- Used a dedicated hitbox for attacks separate from the player's bounds

### Next Steps
- Proceed to Phase 4: Procedural Generation (Basic Placeholder)
  - Define room/dungeon data structures
  - Implement simplistic dungeon generator
  - Render dungeon layout
  - Spawn player in starting room

### Documentation
- Updated architecture.md with combat system details
- Added collision system documentation

## Phase 4: Procedural Generation (Basic Placeholder) (COMPLETED)

**Date:** 2025-05-06

### Summary
Successfully implemented the basic placeholder for procedural dungeon generation, including room and dungeon data structures, a simple dungeon generator, rendering of the dungeon layout, and spawning the player in the starting room.

### Achievements
1. **Room/Dungeon Data Structures**
   - Created Room class with Rectangle bounds and center point calculation
   - Implemented Dungeon class to contain a list of rooms with a designated starting room
   - Designed with future procedural generation expansion in mind

2. **Dungeon Generator**
   - Developed DungeonGenerator class with GenerateSimpleDungeon method
   - Implemented hardcoded room placement as a placeholder
   - Added room validation to ensure all rooms fit within the viewport

3. **Dungeon Rendering**
   - Added room outline rendering in the Gameplay state
   - Created utility methods for rectangle outline drawing
   - Implemented clean rendering that clearly shows room boundaries

4. **Player/Enemy Positioning**

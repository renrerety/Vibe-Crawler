# Aetherium Depths Implementation Progress

## Phase 1: Project Setup & Basic Architecture (COMPLETED)

**Date:** 2025-05-04

### Summary
Successfully implemented the project setup and basic architecture for Aetherium Depths. This includes creating the project structure, implementing the core game loop, and establishing a state management system.

### Achievements
1. **Project Structure**
   - Created a MonoGame Cross-Platform Desktop project
   - Established directory structure for modularity (Core, Gameplay, Generation, Entities, UI)
   - Set up for future cross-platform development

2. **Basic Game Loop**
   - Implemented the AetheriumGame class extending MonoGame's Game class
   - Added console logging to verify Initialize, LoadContent, Update, and Draw methods
   - Set up basic game loop structure with appropriate method calls

3. **State Management**
   - Created StateManager class to handle game states (MainMenu, Gameplay, Paused)
   - Implemented state transitions with event notifications
   - Added debugging controls (P key to toggle Pause, M key for MainMenu)
   - Established state-specific Update and Draw methods

### Technical Details
- Used C# with MonoGame framework
- Implemented event-based state management for clean separation of concerns
- Designed with modularity in mind to support future development
- Added proper logging to verify system operation

### Next Steps
- Proceed to Phase 2: Player Entity & Basic Movement
  - Create Player class with position and sprite
  - Implement InputManager for abstracted input handling
  - Add basic movement mechanics
  - Implement screen boundaries

### Documentation
- Created initial architecture.md to document the project structure and components
- Updated with diagrams of data flow and component relationships

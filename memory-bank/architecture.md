# Aetherium Depths Architecture

**Version:** 0.5
**Date:** 2025-05-08
**Phase:** 5 - Aetherium Weaving (Core Hook - Minimal) + Preparing for Next Phase

## 1. Overview

This document outlines the architecture of the Aetherium Depths game, a 2D top-down real-time action roguelike / dungeon crawler. The project uses MonoGame as its core framework and follows a modular design approach to support cross-platform development.

## 2. Project Structure

The project is organized into the following directory structure:

```
AetheriumDepths/ (Root Project Folder)
  AetheriumGame.cs (Main game class)
  Program.cs (Entry point)
  Core/ (Fundamental systems)
    StateManager.cs (Game state management)
    InputManager.cs (Input handling)
    CollisionUtility.cs (Collision detection)
  Gameplay/ (Core game logic - placeholder)
  Generation/ (Procedural generation logic)
    Room.cs (Room representation)
    Dungeon.cs (Dungeon container)
    DungeonGenerator.cs (Dungeon generation logic)
  Entities/ (Base classes/components)
    Player.cs (Player entity)
    Enemy.cs (Enemy entity)
    WeavingAltar.cs (Aetherium Weaving altar)
  UI/ (Custom UI elements - placeholder)
  Content/ (MonoGame Content Pipeline definition)
```

Future development will expand this structure to support additional platform targets (Android/iOS) through dedicated projects.

## 3. Key Components

### 3.1. Core Game Loop (AetheriumGame.cs)

The `AetheriumGame` class extends MonoGame's `Game` class and implements the main game loop:
- **Initialize**: Sets up core systems and components
- **LoadContent**: Loads game assets (textures, sounds, etc.)
- **Update**: Processes game logic based on the current state
- **Draw**: Renders the game based on the current state

This main game class uses the StateManager to control which states are active and delegates specific update and draw logic to state-specific methods.

### 3.2. State Management (StateManager.cs)

The `StateManager` class provides a mechanism for handling different game states and transitions between them:

- **States**: MainMenu, Gameplay, Paused, GameOver
- **Current State**: Tracks which state is active
- **State Transitions**: Handles switching between states with appropriate events

The state manager allows the game to have distinct behaviors in different states while maintaining a clean separation of concerns. It uses an event system to notify subscribers of state changes.

### 3.3. Input Management (InputManager.cs)

The `InputManager` class abstracts input handling across different devices:

- **Input Mapping**: Maps raw input (keyboard, gamepad) to game actions
- **GameAction Enum**: Defines all possible game actions (MoveUp, MoveDown, MoveLeft, MoveRight, Attack, Dodge, Interact)
- **Movement Vector**: Provides a normalized vector for player movement

This abstraction simplifies cross-platform development and allows for easy control scheme reconfiguration.

### 3.4. Player Entity (Player.cs)

The `Player` class handles player-specific behaviors:

- **Position and Sprite**: Basic rendering properties
- **Movement**: Direction-based movement with speed control
- **Health System**: CurrentHealth and MaxHealth tracking with damage handling
- **Attack System**: Temporary hitbox creation in facing direction
- **Dodge System**: Temporary speed boost and invincibility
- **Aetherium Essence**: Resource used for weaving abilities
- **Buff System**: Tracks active buffs (currently only damage buff)
- **Key Management**: Tracking collected keys and consumption for doors
- **State Management**: Tracking attack, dodge, and buff states
- **Visual Feedback**: Visual indicators for damage, invincibility, and buff states

### 3.5 Combat System

The combat system consists of several components working together:

- **Collision Detection**: AABB (Axis-Aligned Bounding Box) collision checks via CollisionUtility
- **Attack Mechanics**: Temporary hitboxes created in player's and enemy's facing direction
- **Damage System**: Health tracking and damage application to enemies and player
- **Invincibility Frames**: Temporary invulnerability during dodge actions and after taking damage
- **Death Handling**: GameOver state transition when player health reaches zero
- **Combat Manager**: Centralized handling of damage application, enemy death detection, and combat effects

### 3.6 Enemy Entity (Enemy.cs)

The `Enemy` class handles enemy-specific behaviors:

- **Basic Properties**: Position, sprite, health, and active state
- **AI Movement**: Detection range and player-seeking behavior
- **AI Combat**: Attack range, cooldown, and attack hitbox generation
- **State Management**: Tracking attack state and cooldowns
- **Death Handling**: Resource rewards and deactivation upon defeat

### 3.7 Game State Flow

The game state flow has been expanded to include:

- **Main Menu**: Starting point for the game (currently placeholder)
- **Gameplay**: Active gameplay with player control and enemy interactions
- **Paused**: Temporarily halts gameplay updates but maintains visual state
- **Game Over**: Displayed when player health reaches zero, with restart option

**Game Over Flow**:
1. Player health reaches zero
2. StateManager transitions to GameOver state
3. Game halts normal updates but displays Game Over screen
4. Player can press 'E' to restart
5. Game resets player health, enemy state, and regenerates dungeon
6. StateManager transitions back to Gameplay state

### 3.8 Dungeon Generation System

The dungeon generation system creates and manages the game's level structure:

- **Room Class**: Stores room bounds, type, and provides utility methods
- **RoomType Enum**: Defines room types (Normal, Start, Treasure)
- **Dungeon Class**: Contains a collection of rooms and corridors, identifies starting room, and manages obstacle bounds
- **BSPNode Class**: Represents nodes in the Binary Space Partitioning tree used for procedural generation
- **DungeonGenerator**: Creates procedurally generated dungeons using a BSP algorithm
- **Room Placement**: Strategic positioning of special room types (Start, Treasure)
- **IsMovementValid**: Enhanced collision checking for level bounds and obstacles
- **Obstacle Management**: Tracking of dynamic obstacles like destructible crates

#### BSP-based Procedural Generation

The game uses a Binary Space Partitioning (BSP) approach for procedural dungeon generation, which has been significantly enhanced to create massive dungeons with numerous large rooms:

1. **Expanded Dungeon Area**:
   - Creates a dungeon area 3x larger than the viewport in both dimensions
   - Centers the dungeon around the viewport for balanced exploration
   - Uses expanded margins (80px) to prevent generation issues at boundaries
   - Supports a full HD game window (1920x1080) for better visualization

2. **Massive BSP Tree Creation**:
   - Starts with a single massive rectangular space representing the entire dungeon area
   - Recursively splits this space over 10 iterations to create 10-15 room spaces
   - Uses intelligent split direction determination based on area aspect ratio
   - Sets minimum leaf size to 800 pixels to support extremely large rooms
   - Creates a rich tree structure optimized for substantial room layouts

3. **Quadruple-Sized Room Generation**:
   - Each leaf node produces a room with minimum dimensions of 720 pixels
   - Rooms occupy up to 85% of their containing leaf node's space
   - Generated rooms are 4x larger than the original implementation
   - Provides arena-like spaces for complex combat encounters
   - Ensures sufficient space for future additions like room-specific features and obstacles

4. **Enhanced Corridor System**:
   - Connects rooms with extra-wide 100-pixel corridors for comfortable navigation
   - Maintains L-shaped corridor design for clear pathfinding
   - Scales corridor width proportionally to match the increased room sizes
   - Optimizes corridor placement based on the BSP tree structure

5. **Smart Starting Room Selection**:
   - Implements center-finding algorithm to identify optimal starting room
   - Selects the room closest to the dungeon center as the starting point
   - Reorders the room list to ensure the starting room is always first
   - Creates more intuitive dungeon progression from center outward

6. **Rendering Optimizations**:
   - Camera system dynamically follows the player through the expanded dungeon
   - Minimap system provides navigation awareness across the massive layout
   - Rendering layers properly handle the significantly larger world space
   - Visual indicators are scaled appropriately for the increased dimensions

This enhanced procedural generation system creates truly expansive dungeons with massive rooms suitable for complex gameplay scenarios, multiple enemies, and varied environmental features. The quadrupling of room dimensions transforms the game experience from confined corridors to epic halls and chambers while maintaining the algorithmic benefits of BSP-based generation.

#### Visualization and Debugging

The system includes debugging visualization features:
- Leaf node boundaries are rendered in green
- Room boundaries are rendered in white with semi-transparent fills
- Corridors are rendered in gray
- The regeneration key (R) allows runtime testing of different dungeon layouts

This procedural approach replaced the initial placeholder system that used hardcoded room positions, offering greater variety and expandability.

### 3.9 Aetherium Weaving System

The Aetherium Weaving system is the core game mechanic that allows players to spend collected essence to gain temporary buffs:

- **Aetherium Essence**: A resource collected from defeated enemies
- **Weaving Altar**: An interactive object where weaving can be performed
- **Interaction System**: AABB collision-based detection for altar interaction
- **Buff System**: Multiple buff types (damage, speed) with independent durations
- **Visual Feedback**: Color changes on the player sprite to indicate active buffs
- **Buff UI**: Simple interface elements showing active buffs and their remaining duration

#### Weaving Implementation

The current implementation provides a functional foundation for the Aetherium Weaving system:

1. The `Player` class tracks `AetheriumEssence` collected from defeated enemies
2. Defeating an enemy grants a fixed amount of essence
3. The `WeavingAltar` class represents a physical location where weaving can occur
4. When the player is near the altar and presses the Interact key (E), a buff selection is presented
5. Pressing a number key (1 for damage, 2 for speed) while interacting will activate the corresponding buff
6. If the player has sufficient essence, it's deducted and the selected buff is activated with a duration
7. The active buffs apply modifiers to player capabilities:
   - Damage buff: Multiplies attack damage
   - Speed buff: Increases movement speed
8. Buffs expire automatically after their duration ends
9. The player's sprite changes color to indicate buff status:
   - Yellow: Damage buff active
   - Green: Speed buff active
   - Orange: Both buffs active
10. UI elements display active buffs with their remaining durations

#### Buff Management System

The buff management system supports independent tracking of multiple buff types:

1. Each buff type has a dedicated duration timer tracked in the `Player` class
2. Duration timers are decremented each frame using delta time for frame-rate independence
3. When a timer reaches zero, the corresponding buff is automatically deactivated
4. The `BuffType` enum allows for easy identification and future expansion of buff types
5. The `GetBuffDuration` method provides remaining time for display in the UI
6. Visual indicators change based on the combination of active buffs

### 3.10 User Interface System

The UI system provides the player with critical information about the game state through visual elements:

- **Health Display**: Shows current and maximum health with both a bar and numeric indicators
- **Aetherium Essence Counter**: Displays the collected essence resource
- **Buff Indicators**: Shows active buffs with remaining duration timers
- **Minimap**: Provides positional awareness of the dungeon layout and entities
- **Interaction Prompts**: Contextual text showing available interactions

#### UI Components

The current implementation includes several UI components:

1. **Text Rendering**
   - Uses MonoGame's SpriteFont system for text display
   - Supports measurement of text for proper positioning
   - Renders dynamic values like health points and duration timers

2. **Health Bar**

3. **Bottom-Center**: Contextual prompts
   - Appears only when relevant
   - Shows available interactions

#### Technical Implementation

The UI system is implemented with several technical features:

1. **Semi-Transparent Panels**
   - Dark backgrounds for better contrast and readability
   - Proper opacity to avoid obscuring the game view

2. **Dynamic Scaling**
   - Health bar scales properly with player's current health
   - Interface elements maintain proper proportions

3. **Coordinate Transformation**
   - Converts world space coordinates to minimap space
   - Maintains proper relative positions of entities
   - Scales appropriately to fit the minimap area

4. **Text Measurements**
   - Uses SpriteFont.MeasureString for proper text positioning
   - Centers text within elements like health bars
   - Ensures readable display of numeric values

5. **Color Coding**
   - Uses consistent colors for game elements
   - Green for health, purple for essence
   - Buff colors match their visual effects on the player
   - Enemy indicators in red for clear distinction

The UI system is designed to be non-intrusive while providing all necessary information for gameplay. It currently uses primitive rendering with colored rectangles and text but has been architecturally designed to allow future enhancement with more sophisticated graphics and animations.

## 8. Conclusion

The Aetherium Depths architecture has established a solid foundation through the first five phases of development. The modular design approach taken from the beginning has positioned us well for the upcoming expansion. Our focus for the next phase will be on enhancing the procedural generation, expanding the combat system, completing the Aetherium Weaving mechanics, and implementing core UI elements.

By addressing the technical debt areas identified and carefully planning the integration of new systems, we will maintain code quality while delivering the expanded feature set. The architectural improvements outlined in this document will guide our development efforts and ensure the game remains scalable and maintainable as it grows in complexity.

## 9. Camera & Collision Systems

### 9.1 Camera System

The camera system in Aetherium Depths provides a dynamic view of the game world, following the player with smooth interpolation to enhance the gaming experience. It consists of the following key components:

#### 9.1.1 Camera2D Class

The `Camera2D` class manages the viewpoint into the game world with these primary features:

1. **Properties**
   - `Position`: The current focal point of the camera in world coordinates
   - `Zoom`: A scaling factor allowing for zoom in/out effects (default: 1.0)
   - `Rotation`: The camera's rotation in radians (default: 0.0)
   - `Viewport`: Reference to the graphics device viewport dimensions

2. **Core Functionality**
   - `GetTransformMatrix()`: Creates a combined transformation matrix for rendering
   - `MoveToTarget()`: Smoothly interpolates the camera position toward a target
   - `UpdateViewport()`: Updates the viewport dimensions when the window size changes

#### 9.1.2 Transformation Pipeline

The camera utilizes a sequence of matrix transformations to convert world coordinates to screen coordinates:

1. **Translation**: Moves the world to center the view at the camera's position (negative offset)
2. **Rotation**: Applies the camera's rotation around its focal point
3. **Scaling**: Applies the zoom factor to scale the view up or down
4. **Origin Translation**: Offsets the result to place the camera focal point at the center of the screen

This pipeline is implemented in the `GetTransformMatrix()` method and applied to the `SpriteBatch` when rendering the game world.

#### 9.1.3 Smooth Following

To prevent jerky camera movement, a smooth following mechanism is implemented:

1. The camera maintains its current position property
2. Each frame, it calculates a new position using `Vector2.Lerp` to interpolate between its current position and the player's position
3. The `CameraLerpFactor` (set to 0.1) controls the speed of the interpolation, with lower values providing smoother but slower camera movement

#### 9.1.4 Rendering Integration

The rendering system is now separated into two distinct passes:

1. **World Rendering**: Uses the camera's transform matrix to render the game world, dungeon, entities, and other world elements
2. **UI Rendering**: Uses an identity matrix (no transformation) to render UI elements in screen space, ensuring they remain fixed regardless of camera movement

### 9.2 Collision & Boundary System

To ensure entities remain within the dungeon's bounds, a comprehensive collision system was implemented:

#### 9.2.1 Walkable Area Definition

The dungeon geometry defines the walkable areas through:

1. **Room Bounds**: Rectangle areas representing each room
2. **Corridor Bounds**: Rectangle segments connecting rooms (width increased to 40 pixels for comfortable traversal)
3. **Combined Walkable Areas**: A collection of all walkable rectangles in the dungeon

#### 9.2.2 Movement Validation

The `Dungeon` class provides validation methods to enforce boundaries:

1. **`GetAllWalkableBounds()`**: Returns a list of all walkable rectangles
2. **`IsPositionValid(Vector2 position)`**: Checks if a single point is within any walkable area
3. **`IsMovementValid(Rectangle bounds)`**: Validates if an entity's bounds are fully contained within walkable areas

The validation approach has been enhanced to handle junction areas more intelligently:
- Each corner of an entity's bounds is checked individually against all walkable areas
- Movement is valid if all corners are within valid areas, even if those areas are different
- This prevents entities from getting stuck at corridor-room junctions
- Early return optimization when all corners are validated improves performance

#### 9.2.3 Movement Implementation

Entity movement now follows this process:

1. Calculate a proposed new position based on input or AI
2. Generate a bounding rectangle at the proposed position
3. Validate the proposed bounds against walkable areas using the enhanced algorithm
4. If valid, update the position; if invalid, attempt to slide along walls by testing X and Y movement separately

This approach creates a more natural feeling movement system, where entities smoothly slide along walls rather than stopping abruptly when hitting boundaries at an angle.

#### 9.2.4 Visual Representation

The visual representation of boundaries has been designed to enhance gameplay:
- Room outlines are rendered with thin (1px) semi-transparent lines
- These boundaries serve as visual indicators without impeding movement
- Corridors use a distinct color to visually differentiate from rooms
- Debug visualization shows BSP partitioning with minimal visual interference

### 9.3 System Integration

The camera and collision systems are tightly integrated with the existing architecture:

1. The `Camera2D` instance is created and managed by the `AetheriumGame` class
2. Entity movement methods (`Player.Move` and `Enemy.Update`) now accept the current `Dungeon` instance for boundary validation
3. The game's `Draw` method separates world and UI rendering into distinct SpriteBatch passes with different transformation matrices
4. The `UpdateGameplay` method updates the camera position based on player movement, creating a continuous feedback loop

This integration enhances the player experience by providing a dynamic view of the procedurally generated dungeons while ensuring entities remain properly constrained within the game world boundaries.

### 9.4 Future Enhancements

Potential future enhancements to these systems include:

1. **Camera Effects**: Screen shake, zoom effects, and smooth transitions between rooms
2. **Advanced Collision**: More sophisticated physics interactions and collision response
3. **Camera Bounds**: Constraining the camera to prevent showing areas outside the dungeon
4. **Target Priorities**: Dynamic camera targeting based on combat or environmental factors
5. **Room Transitions**: Special camera behavior when moving between rooms
